# Obobo Nodes Requirements
# These are the minimal dependencies required for the obobo nodes to function

# Core Python dependencies (usually included with ComfyUI)
# No additional packages required beyond standard Python libraries

# The nodes use only standard Python libraries:
# - logging (built-in)
# - os (built-in)
# - folder_paths (provided by ComfyUI)

# If you encounter any issues, ensure you have:
# - Python 3.8 or higher
# - A working ComfyUI installation
# - Proper file system permissions for the custom_nodes directory

# Note: These nodes are designed to be lightweight and have minimal dependencies
# to ensure maximum compatibility with different ComfyUI setups.
